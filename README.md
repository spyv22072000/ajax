 Project Description: Building a Todo List using Node.js, Express.js, and jQuery for AJAX

The goal of this project is to create a web-based Todo List application using Node.js, Express.js, and jQuery for AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests. The application will allow users to create, manage, and organize their tasks in a user-friendly interface.

Key Features:
1. User Registration and Authentication: Users will be able to register for an account and log in securely to access their personalized Todo List.

2. Create and Manage Tasks: Users can create new tasks, assign due dates, set priorities, and categorize tasks into different lists or tags.

3. Task Filtering and Sorting: Users can easily filter and sort tasks based on various parameters such as due date, priority, or category to quickly find specific tasks.

4. Marking Completed Tasks: Users can mark tasks as completed, which will visually indicate their status and help users track their progress.

5. Task Editing and Deletion: Users can edit task details such as the title, due date, priority, and category. They can also delete tasks when they are no longer needed.

6. User-Friendly Interface: The application will provide an intuitive and visually appealing interface for users to interact with their Todo List. It will include features like drag-and-drop for task rearrangement and responsive design for seamless usage across different devices.

7. AJAX Integration with jQuery: To enhance user experience and avoid page refreshes, AJAX requests will be used for asynchronous interactions with the server. jQuery will be employed to handle these requests, making the application more dynamic and efficient.

8. Data Persistence: The application will utilize a database (such as MongoDB or MySQL) to store and retrieve task data. This will ensure that users' tasks are saved and accessible across different sessions.

9. Error Handling and Validation: Proper error handling and input validation will be implemented to ensure data integrity and provide a smooth user experience.

10. Deployment: The final application will be deployed on a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku or AWS) to make it accessible to users over the internet.

Overall, this project will demonstrate proficiency in utilizing Node.js, Express.js, and jQuery for building a functional and interactive Todo List application. It will showcase skills in handling user authentication, managing data with a database, and implementing AJAX for seamless user interactions.
